Goal : log into the game using SSH
----------------------------------
SSH = Secure Shell
Provides Secure remote access, encrypted data communications and strong authentication

----------------------------------

Host: bandit.labs.overthewire.org
port: 2220

This challenge is to simply log into Bandit's machine using SSH
For that we will be needing the ssh command

------------------------------------------------------------------
The username and password for bandit0 level are given:
username : bandit0
password : bandit0

To login:

$ sudo ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

NOTE: they recommend using port 2220 so we pass the argument -p to direct to that port

After that, we enter the given username and password and login into their game/system

For this challenge, ls and cat command is very useful

$ ls
NOTE : lists all the files in that current directory
$ cat <filename>
NOTE : displays the content inside that file

The password for the next level : Level 1 is stored in a file (no spoilers) in the system.
